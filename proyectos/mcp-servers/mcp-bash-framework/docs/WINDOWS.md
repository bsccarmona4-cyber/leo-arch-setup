# Windows Support Notes

mcp-bash is CI-tested on Windows using Git Bash (MSYS2). WSL also works and behaves like native Linux. Choose based on your needs:

- **Git Bash**: CI-validated, ships with Git for Windows, lower setup friction
- **WSL**: Behaves like Linux (signal handling, symlinks work correctly), but not separately CI-tested

## Guidance
- Git Bash is CI-tested and works for most use cases with the documented workarounds.
- WSL behaves like Linux; if you need reliable signal handling or symlinks, it's a good choice.
- Git Bash/MSYS may drop signals; prefer short timeouts for long-running tools.
- Providers translate `C:\foo` to `/c/foo`; avoid mixing Windows and POSIX roots.
- Set `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=*` when passing raw Windows paths to tools.
- Install JSON tooling manually (`pacman -S jq` or a downloaded `gojq`).

## Executable detection
Windows fakes execute bits. The scanner falls back to `.sh`/`.bash` extensions and shebangs when `-x` is unreliable. Use `.sh` plus `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, or register tools declaratively via `server.d/register.json` (preferred). Hook-based registration via `server.d/register.sh` also works but is opt-in (`MCPBASH_ALLOW_PROJECT_HOOKS=true`).

## gojq notes
`gojq` v0.12.16 struggles with `--slurpfile` on Windows. Prefer `cat file.ndjson | jq -s '...'` and use standard `jq` when available.

## Tool environment isolation
When `MCPBASH_TOOL_ENV_MODE` is `minimal` (default) or `allowlist`, tool execution isolates the environment using **bash built-ins** (rather than invoking the external `env` binary). This reduces the risk of `E2BIG` / `Argument list too long` failures on Git Bash/MSYS when the host environment (often `PATH`) is large.

## CI (GitHub Actions)
- Git Bash runners can hit `Argument list too long` (`E2BIG`) when `gojq` launches with a large PATH/env.
- Export `MCPBASH_JSON_TOOL=jq` and `MCPBASH_JSON_TOOL_BIN="$(command -v jq)"` before invoking `mcp-bash` to pin jq and avoid the Windows exec-limit issue.
- Stick to `jq` for CI to bypass the Git Bash argument-length ceiling; fall back to `gojq` only on platforms without the Windows exec limit.
